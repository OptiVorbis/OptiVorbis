# This binary target has the same name as the main library target.
# In general, Cargo does not support that, but it is only troublesome
# for us when running rustdoc, as the binary and library executables
# do not clash otherwise. See:
# https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6313
# This binary crate is straightforward enough to not need documentation,
# so let's just not document it.
